# Marauders' Map Annotation Project

A scholarly digital edition analyzing the Marauders' Map as a magical object and symbol within the Harry Potter series.

## Project Goals

- To create a structured, citable annotation of every known appearance of the Marauders' Map in the Harry Potter novels.
- To analyze the map's symbolic significance as a tool of rebellion, friendship, and information control.
- To examine character motivations and thematic connections revealed through the map's usage.
- To provide a transparent research process using GitHub's collaboration features.

## Methodology

1. **Textual Analysis**: Each appearance is documented by book and chapter.
2. **Annotation Template**: Each entry includes Scene Description, Symbolic Analysis, Character Motivation, and Thematic Connection.
3. **Collaborative Workflow**: Using GitHub Issues for task management, Pull Requests for contributions, and Code Review for peer feedback.
